			<p>Bullying—and race-based bullying—happens all the time, all over the place. Often, we experience, see, or
				are part of bullying situations but don't say anything, because we don't recognize it's bullying in the
				moment, and/or we're scared or worried about making things worse. </p>
			<p>But in order to create a world without bullying, and treat one another with respect, we need to know what
				the problems are and when and where they’re happening. That’s why we’ve created the Bullied Button, a
				tool to count times when and where bullying happens. It’s quick, safe, and anonymous. If you have
				experienced, seen, or participated in a bullying situation, please log it now using the button above.
