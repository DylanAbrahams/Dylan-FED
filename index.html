				<h1>A CAMPAIGN TO ADDRESS RACE-BASED BULLYING</h1>
				<p>Racial stereotypes, mean jokes, and calling folks names has never been ok. But bullying happens so
					often
					and in so many different ways, it can start to feel almost normal.</p>
				<p>We're looking to change the narrative. We need your help to Right Our Story.</p>
				<p>We need your stories of bullying—whether you watched it happen, were on the receiving end, or even
					were
					the bully (it happens, but we're all here to learn).</p>
				<p><em>These stories will be shared anonymously (unless you say it's okay to use your first name) to
						show how all of us have experienced bullying in one way or another—and give us a path forward to
						dismantle bullying in our everyday lives. With your input, we can write a better story,
						together.</em></p>

				<h2>Help Right Our Story by Sharing Yours</h2>
				<p>We need your story to add to the conversation around race-based bullying. As a storytelling campaign
					geared towards shifting the narrative and fostering a collective responsibility to address bullying
					in
					our communities, we want to learn about your personal, first-hand experiences. Your story can give
					hope
					to others when they can see themselves in your shoes and know they're not alone.</p>
				<p>So we need your story - join the movement to create a world without bullying.</p>
				<p>Share how you've experienced bullying. Share how you've seen bullying happen in your school or
					community.
					Or share how you may have bullied someone else.</p>
				<p>We'll use these stories in the Right Our Story campaign to illustrate how we're all impacted by
					bullying.
					This campaign is youth-led, so we need your stories, in your voice.</p>
				<p>It doesn't need to be perfect. It's powerful because it's personal, it's yours.</p>

						alt="When I was in elementary school I used to have big teeth and people used to call me bunny teeth and it made me really sad. But now I grew into my teeth, it's not such a big gap, and I learned to  accept my teeth and not be ashamed or embarrased about them.">
				</li>
				<li><img src="./images/Story3.png"
						alt="At my last school it was predominantly white. I was one of the few black girls. They would call me and say the N word and when I would tell someone they wouldn't do anything. They kept doing this for months and nothing would change.">
				</li>
				<li><img src="./images/Story4.png"
						alt="People think it is funny or some joke to make fun of me for being Asian. 'Ching Chong' or 'dog eater' may seem funny or a joke but they still mean something. Being racist torwards Asians is very normalized, stop this.">
				</li>
				<li><img src="./images/Story5.png"
						alt="I've been bullied over my weight, whenever I tried to make a counter-argument, they would just say 'nobody asked, fatty' and they just continued saying stuff like that.">
				</li>
				<li><img src="./images/Story6.png"
						alt="I am a part of a mostly white friend group. I'm only part Asian but I am still of color. They always call me whitewashed and say I'm 'basically white' when that's really their fault. They say I'm in white classes but my mom would be mad if I wasn't. Maybe I am overreacting but it hurts.">
				</li>
				<li><img src="./images/Story7.png"
						alt="I was always bullied for being dark, for instance kids would say that i'm too dark to go to their school, people would say I need to go back to Africa where I belong. I was always the ugly one in the group, I still feel that way till this day. I hope that one day I just heal and I'm able to love myself just as much as others love me.">
